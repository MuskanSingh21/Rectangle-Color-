Here's a small project, in which there is a rectangle which gives some effect like when we move our mouse over the rectangle then rectangle having a color of Red and Blue . 
One twist here, that when our mouse is left side of rectangle the color will be Red and when it's on right side the color will be Blue . 
There is one thing more i.e, the opacity of color increases or decreases based on how much left or right our mouse moves over the rectangle .
